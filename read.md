How to Setup before write code to configure
1. On Windows download : CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver to connect your board using window OS
2. Download Thonny and configure

IR sensor is a device that uses infrared technology to detect objects or changes in the environment. IR sensors 
can detect a wide range of physical properties such as temperature, motion and proximity.  
The white LED here is an IR LED which works as the transmitter 
and the component next to the IR LED is a photodiode that 
works as the receiver in the IR sensor. 
The IR transmitter continuously emits the IR light and the IR 
receiver keeps on checking for the reflected light. If the light 
gets reflected back by hitting any object in front it, the IR 
receiver receives this light. This way the object is detected in 
the case of the IR sensor. 
The Distance Adjust here is a potentiometer. You can control the range i.e. from how far you want to detect 
the object by changing the value of the potentiometer. 
An IR sensor has two small LED indicators – Power LED, which is ON the entire time the sensor is ON; the 
other is the Obstacle LED which detects the object. The Obstacle LED has two states or situations: 
• ON (Active) when it detects an object. 
• OFF (Inactive) when it doesn’t detect any object.
